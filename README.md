# Pymaceuticals Data Analysis
 Applied Matplotlib data and library knowledge to a real-world situation and dataset.

# Repo Direction 
Created a new repository for this project called #Matplotlib-Data-Visualization, Cloned the new repository(remote) to local by terminal.

Inside my local Git repository, created a folder for "Pymaceuticals"

Added Jupyter notebook "(pymaceuticals_starter_Roshni.ipynb)" to this folder. This is the main script to run this analysis.

A Data folder that contains the CSV files(Raw Data) i have used. 

Also this folder that contains "pdf" file that has the results from the conducted analysis.

Pushed these changes to GitHub profile by bash terminal.
